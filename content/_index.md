## About this page

This book collects all my self-learning topics starting from Dec 2024. It serves as a notebook for big pictures. Though typing Latex is good-looking, I will use much handwriting in order to save time. All pdf files are stored in [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Certificates from coursera/edx are collected [here](./docs/certificates). For Hugo theme, I use [Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/).

> A rough start is the best start.
