Inside simulation # Key settings: Delay, Decay\nWhen you click \u0026ldquo;simulate\u0026rdquo;\nStep 1: Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the alpha vector for the given date.\nStep 2: From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group. Sum of all vector values = 0. (Neutralization)\nStep 3: The resulting values are scaled or ‘normalized’ such that the absolute sum of the alpha vector values is 1. These values can be called as normalized weights.\nStep 4: Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital (from a fictitious book of $20 million) to each stock to construct a portfolio.\nStep 5: Calculate next day PnL based on observed stock returns the next day.\nStep 6: Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period (IS) to get daily PnL generated for each day.\nStep 7: Calculate the cumulative PnL of the alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the alpha.\nIf Decay is used $$ \\text{Decay_linear}(x,n)=\\frac{x_t\\times n+x_{t-1}\\times (n-1)+\\cdots+x_{t-n-1}}{n+(n-1)+\\cdots+1} $$\n2.

It won\u0026rsquo;t match if one is broken.\nLast line (hash) is repeated as the first line in the next block. -\u0026gt; chain\nAltering any data in block 1 means the last line will change and will not match the first line in block 2.\nHashing\nSHA256\nHashing is a one-way function\nEthereum blockchain uses Keccak-256\nMiners add some data called nonce (number only once) to find a hash that get lots of leading zeros. It makes it difficult for adversary to change a block then change the future blocks to make everything works. Miners give blockchain unprecedented security.\nAn attacker needs to amass 51% of the network power (boundary of PoW security)\nCryptocurrency\nIt is a digital token.\nasymmetric key cryptography private key \u0026amp; public key: like ssh\nUsers of smart contracts need to pay a fee called gas.\nEthereum is turing complete -\u0026gt; 1. if 2. for loop 3. store data\nIn the context of smart contract platforms, an oracle is any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain.\nMining is asscocated with both strength (security) and weakness (costly).\nReasons of cryptos being volatility: no tangible value, bad liquidity\nProblems DeFi Solved # Risk # DeFi closes the counterparty risk, and introduces a new class of risks.\nSmart contract risk # The key component in DeFi is a smart contract. If there are issues with that smart contract, then that opens the door to an exploit.\nThe software foundation gives attackers a large attack surface. Public blockchains are open systems, so if there\u0026rsquo;s any flaw in the code, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be exploited. This won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem in CeFi because people cannot enter the private website. This new attack vector is termed smart contract risk.\nAudit\nYou develop your smart contract, you want to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s no mistake.
