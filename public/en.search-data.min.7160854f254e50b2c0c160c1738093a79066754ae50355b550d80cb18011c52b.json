Though low cost for one, high cost for millions 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto Raised blockchain and proof-of-work. PoW ensures that the ledger could not be edited unless extreme computing power was available.\nCrypto\neliminates the problem of double-spending every transaction kept in immutable ledger cryptographic scarcity: 21 million bitcoins user sovereignty portability Ethereum: uses smart contract\ndApps: no centralized, network effects\nProof-of-Work is a consensus mechanism of Bitcoin, used to solve \u0026ldquo;double spending\u0026rdquo; problem.\nDeFi Foundations # Blockchain # Trust is within technology, not different parties \u0026ndash; very different from CeFi.\nBlockchain is a special ledger\ndistributed Every 10 min, Bitcoin broke into blocks and check the fingerprint of the connection part of each block. It won\u0026rsquo;t match if one is broken.\nLast line (hash) is repeated as the first line in the next block. -\u0026gt; chain\nAltering any data in block 1 means the last line will change and will not match the first line in block 2.\nHashing\nSHA256\nHashing is a one-way function\nEthereum blockchain uses Keccak-256\nMiners add some data called nonce (number only once) to find a hash that get lots of leading zeros. It makes it difficult for adversary to change a block then change the future blocks to make everything works. Miners give blockchain unprecedented security.\nAn attacker needs to amass 51% of the network power (boundary of PoW security)\nCryptocurrency\nIt is a digital token.\nasymmetric key cryptography private key \u0026amp; public key: like ssh\nUsers of smart contracts need to pay a fee called gas.\nEthereum is turing complete -\u0026gt; 1. if 2. for loop 3. store data\nIn the context of smart contract platforms, an oracle is any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain.\nMining is asscocated with both strength (security) and weakness (costly).\nReasons of cryptos being volatility: no tangible value, bad liquidity\nProblems DeFi Solved # Risk # DeFi closes the counterparty risk, and introduces a new class of risks.\nSmart contract risk # The key component in DeFi is a smart contract. If there are issues with that smart contract, then that opens the door to an exploit.\nThe software foundation gives attackers a large attack surface. Public blockchains are open systems, so if there\u0026rsquo;s any flaw in the code, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be exploited. This won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem in CeFi because people cannot enter the private website. This new attack vector is termed smart contract risk.\nAudit\nYou develop your smart contract, you want to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s no mistake. So companies will employ a third party auditor to go through and stress test the smart contract. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll employ two auditors.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/learn/docs/winter-25/","title":"Winter 25","section":"Docs","content":" Schedule # Starts on: 1.12 Ends on: 2.15\nDuke FinTech # Decentralized finance: 1.12 ~ 1.13 Daily Basis # Machine learning with python: 1.29 ~ Review on Undergrad Math # Probability Statistics Financial mathematics Numerical analysis Time series analysis Learn New # ODE Deep learning: 1.22 ~ Review on Finance # Investment Financial engineering "},{"id":2,"href":"/learn/docs/worldquantbrain/","title":"WorldQuant BRAIN","section":"Docs","content":" Schedule # Introduction "},{"id":3,"href":"/learn/docs/winter-25/dl/","title":"Deep learning","section":"Winter 25","content":"Textbook: Datawhale - 深度学习详解\nVideo: 李宏毅机器学习2021\nHomework: ML2021-Spring\nDate Topic 1.25 Colab | Pytorch 1.26 Reading | Homework 1 1.27 Lecture 2 1.28 Reading | Homework 2 1.29 Lecture 3 "},{"id":4,"href":"/learn/docs/pending/","title":"Pending","section":"Docs","content":" Pending # Introduction to Advanced Calculus Algebra: Elementary to Advanced Matrix Algebra Probability Theory Introduction to Statistics Differential Equations Discrete Math Akuna Capital Options 101 Algorithms Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance Object Oriented Programming in Java Financial Engineering and Risk Management Python Classes and Inheritance Vector Calculus "},{"id":5,"href":"/learn/docs/reproduce/","title":"Reproduce","section":"Docs","content":" Papers to read/reproduce # Discovering Logical Formulaic Alphas using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trading via Image Classification "},{"id":6,"href":"/learn/docs/certificates/","title":"Certificates","section":"Docs","content":" Certificates # Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Infrastructure - 1.12 "},{"id":7,"href":"/learn/docs/reproduce/feng-xu-2024/","title":"Feng xu (2024)","section":"Reproduce","content":" Discovering Logical Formulaic Alphas using Deep Reinforcement Learning # Paper Code "},{"id":8,"href":"/learn/docs/winter-25/ml_with_python/","title":"ML with python (MITx)","section":"Winter 25","content":" micromaster "},{"id":9,"href":"/learn/docs/reproduce/naftali-cohen-2020/","title":"Naftali Cohen (2020)","section":"Reproduce","content":" Trading via Image Classification # Paper Code "},{"id":10,"href":"/learn/docs/winter-25/ode/","title":"ODE","section":"Winter 25","content":"Textbook: Ordinary Differential Equation (Zhonglei Wang)\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/learn/docs/winter-25/probability/","title":"Probability recap","section":"Winter 25","content":"Textbook: A First Course in Probability\nCoursera: Probability Theory\n"}]
